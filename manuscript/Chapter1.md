Setting up a Project
--------------------

Initializing an R project is a good way to keep all of your files and
directories straight. If you do not do this, you will inevitably lose
track of what file directory R is pointing to. Then you will save data,
figures, or images in unexpected locations. To get used to working with
different projects, we will create a new project for each chapter of
this book.
