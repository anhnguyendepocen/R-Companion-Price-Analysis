# Chapter 1: Getting Started with R and RStudio

In this chapter we will walk through a short introduction to R and RStudio. There are many free and comprehensive tutorials available on the web, so our focus here will be to introduce only the concepts and functionality that we need to get started with price analysis as quickly as possible. Readers who come to this book because they want to do price analysis professionally using R will probably want to go back and learn R in a more comprehensive way after they have finished *Commodity Price Analysis* and the *R Companion*. At the end of this chapter I list some excellent tutorials available for free on the web, and there are many more not listed here. 

## Background

For history on the development of R, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is probably the best source. 

> R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R language is widely used among 
statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. ... R is an implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical scoping semantics inspired by Scheme. S was created by John Chambers while at Bell Labs. There are some
important differences, but much of the code written for S runs unaltered. R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the
University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by the R Development Core Team, of which Chambers is a member. R is
named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of S. R is a GNU project. The source
code for the R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R. R is freely available under the GNU General Public
License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems. R uses a command line interface; there are also
several graphical front-ends for it. [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))

R as an open source project has been developed for decades now - which means people have written solutions and made them available for free for all kinds of problems related to statistics, programming, analytics and much more. Whatever kind of work you want to do related to statistics, there is a good chance someone has already done the hard work for you. All you have to do is find it and figure out how to implement it. For price analysis, we will cover the basics here.

R by itself functions through a command line interface, which is not very convenient unless you are very technically inclined. Thankfully, there are several Graphical interfaces (called integrated development environments (IDE)) which makes life a lot easier. Some key functionality is available through clickable menus and viewing panes - just like the vast majority of software we are used to interacting with. My favorite is RStudio, and it is what we will use throughout this book. 

If you do not have any background programming, this may all sound daunting. Believe me, using R and RStudio is more accessible than it sounds. Let jump right in and get started. Since R and RStudio are open source, it is avaiable for free to download.   

## Download R

Go to [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/), where the software is avaiable for downloading.

Click "download R", and scroll to a server mirror close to you. It does not matter much which one you choose; mirrors that are phyically closer to you will produce downloads marginally faster, but if you are in the United States, for example, and you choose any of the mirrors located in the United States, you are not likely to notice a difference. 

When you click a mirror you will see a screen like the following:

## Setting up a Project

Initializing an R project is a good way to keep all of your files and directories straight. If you do not do this, you will inevitably lose track of what file directory R is pointing to. Then you will save data, figures, or images in unexpected locations. To get used to working with different projects, we will create a new project for each chapter of this book.
