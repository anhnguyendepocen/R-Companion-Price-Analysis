I am writing *Commodity Price Analysis: Understand and Produce Market
Commentary and Forecasts* and *R Companion to Commodity Price Analysis*
while teaching ACE 427, an upper level course on Price Analysis at the
University of Illinois. The books are intended to be read together, but
one could read *Commodity Price Analysis* without reading the *R
Companion*. I am writing them as separate books because I can imagine
some will prefer to read the general coverage of *Commodity Price
Analysis* and may not be interested in learning R for analysis.

I am releasing these books while they are very early in development.
Partly because the Lean Publishing model of 'Publish Early, Publish
Often' (with reader feedback) appeals to me. Another concern is purely
practical. I want to use this book for classes in Fall 2015 and chapters
will be finished only shortly before I assign readings and exercises.
Because the book is in its early development stage, expect typos and
other errors in the books. Knowing this, I am releasing the book for
free, at least through December. During this time I will be rapidly
releasing updates to keep up with my course.

I am eager to hear reader feedback about the structure and scope of the
books; I will appreciate any feedback you have. If you find errors,
please alert me via the [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com).
