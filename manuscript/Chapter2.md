Chapter 2: Getting Started
==========================

In Chapter 2 of *Price Analysis* we covered many sources for obtaining
price and market fundamental data. In this chapter of the R companion,
we will learn how to import these data in a variety of ways, including
an api (application program interface) call. Using api's greatly reduce
the work and time required to get up and running with an analysis, and
more entities provide api access all the time.

We will keep the introduction here to the bare minimum required to get
us up and running and performing price analysis. There are many
excellent examples with thorough introductory exercises to R programming
on the web. I encourage you to explore them widely.

Data Import From Files on Your Hard Drive
-----------------------------------------

Beginning analysis with R usually involves importing data from our hard
drive. First we will download some data from [Quandl](Quandl.com).
